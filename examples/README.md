# Examples

This directory contains different doctool examples.

Each of the sub-directories have to be built with the specific doctool
and its output has to be saved into `public/<sub-directory>` so it can be tested.

_There is no need to inject the `readthedocs-addons.js` script into the HTML files.
This will be done automatically by the dev server, emulating what CloudFlare will do for us._
